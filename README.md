# Guess-My-Number
The Guess the Number Game is a simple yet engaging web-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the game provides instant feedback by displaying hints such as "Too high!" or "Too low!" based on the player's guess. With each incorrect attempt, the player's score decreases, adding a challenge to the game. If the player correctly guesses the number, the game updates the background color, displays a success message, and tracks the highest score achieved. Additionally, a reset button allows players to restart the game at any time. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and functions, making it a great learning experience for beginners.
